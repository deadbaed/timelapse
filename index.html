<h1>timelapse.canvas.place</h1>

<p>April 4, 2017 - January 21, 2020</p>

<p>The canvas closed on January 21st 2020.<br>
After nearly 3 years of operation, I'm very happy of what the community accomplished during all this time.<br>
I started this timelapse when I was in high school, bored in my bedroom with nothing to do.<br>
This project kept me motivated to provide a piece of content to a bunch of people regularely.<br>
Even though sometimes it was hard to keep it running to please everyone, I'm still happy with the result.<br>
</p>

<p>When the canvas closed, I spent all night digging in my archives to find all the footage of the canvas from start to finish.<br>
I made the final final timelapse, which has all the footage I have. I hope you like it!<br>
Thank you for coming to the timelapse.<br>
Maybe we will see again on the internet. Seeya! üòâ<br>
